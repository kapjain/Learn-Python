Inheritance: Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class.  The class whose properties and methods are 
    inherited is known as Parent class. And the class that inherits the properties from the parent class is the Child class.

1. Single Inheritance
2. Heirarchical Inheritance
3. Multiple Inheritance
4. Multilevel Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance: The inheritance in which the derivation of a class involves more than one form of any inheritance is 
                       called hybrid inheritance.  
Method Resolution Order (MRO) : It's the order in which method should be inherited in the presence of multiple inheritance. You can view the MRO by using
                                 __mro__ attribute.

print(Fourth.__mro__) or print(help(Fourth))
(
<class '__main__.Fourth'>, 
<class '__main__.Third'>, 
<class '__main__.Second'>, 
<class '__main__.First'>, 
<class '__main__.Zeroth'>, 
<class '__main__.Number'>, 
<class 'object'>
)

Here is how MRO is calculated in Python:  
    1. A method in the derived calls is always called before the method of the base class. 
    In our example, Third class is called before First or Second. These two classes are called before Zeroth which is called before Number, and Number class is called before object.
    2. the class which is appear first, method will get called for that class only in case of same method.
    If there are multiple parents like Third(First, Second), method of First class is invoked first because it appears first.

This is occasionally useful to clients as well. (Note that this only works if the base class is accessible as BaseClassName in the global scope.)
